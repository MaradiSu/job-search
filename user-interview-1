The first set of user interview questions:

(1) How do you currently manage your job applications?
(2) If you could create any tool to streamline your application process, what would it be?
(3) Whatâ€™s the most frustrating part of applying to jobs for you?
(4) On a scale of 1 to 10, how important is networking to you?
(5) Estimate the average amount of time you spend per job application.
(6) Would you be interested in a tool that helped track applications, networking contacts and various "todo list" tasks?

=> Each interview will be less than 15 minutes and will be conducted informally and in person.
